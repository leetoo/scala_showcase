# Scala Showcase

 A lot of scripts useful to learn and train others in Scala.
 Before use it I recommend visit [Twitter Scala School!](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/index.html) and when you feel that implements your test are better in files than Scala REPL you are welcome to clone **Scala Showcase**.

## How to use

In **Unix** system:

    $bash xxx.scala

In **Windows** system:

    $xxx.bat

**Note 1:** Script comments are in .scala files.

**Note 2:** We assume here the file script.sh has execute access and the search path for the scala command is specified in the PATH environment variable.

## List of examples

01. Simple Script - A Hello World example as Script.
02. Simple Class - A simple Classes example.
03. Case Class - Case Class example - TODO
